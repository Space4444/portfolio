            This is 3-channel pulse generator made on stm32 with STM32CubeMX and Keil µVision. It generates square pulses with configurable frequency,
            duty cycle and phase shift between channels. Frequency ranges from less than 1 Hz up to 36 MHz.

        <div className='my-2'>
            It provides automatic synchronization between channels.
            If you change the period of the 1-st channel, then periods of other channels will automatically change to the nearest values that divide period of the 1-st channel.
            But if you don't need synchronization, you can just change frequency of 2-nd or 3-rd channel and it will not affect other channels.

            Also it memorizes it's configuration and loads it on restart.
